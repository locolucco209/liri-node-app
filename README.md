# liri-node-app

* This project pulls data for three API's sources:
	- Twitter
	- Spotify
	- ODB

*User's can get started with this project by checking out my JS code. But you will need your own API's.

*If you need help with the API's go to the website developer tools or youtube. There is tons of info.

*I built this project and it is maintain by the Westside Connection Group.
